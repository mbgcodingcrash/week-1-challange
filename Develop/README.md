# Code Refactor Starter Code


GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code  
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
Adding correct HTML labes in header foorter article etc

fixed bug with the link for search engine optimization not working. 


WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning


WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes


WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order


WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
